HackMd will be used, but due to it's limited push count it's hard to push all changes to github. I think about ubgrading to premium plan, but for now workflow is like that:
- Note is created on someones account
- It should be shared -> throught share
- Every consecutive version should be added to github by downloading file and placing it in directory folder
